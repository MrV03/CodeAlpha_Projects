Created a presentation or online training module about phishing attacks, educating others about recognizing and avoiding phishing emails, websites, and social engineering tactics.

    Technologies: Presentation software (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides)
    Folder: Phishing_Awareness_Presentation

3. Sniffer

Developed a network sniffer tool to monitor and analyze network traffic.

    Technologies: Python, Scapy
    Folder: Sniffer

Mobile App Development
1. Fitness Tracker App

Developed a fitness tracking app that allows users to record and track their workouts, set fitness goals, and view their progress over time. Includes features for recording different types of exercises and workouts.

    Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
